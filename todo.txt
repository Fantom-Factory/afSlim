For 1.0.0
=========

Allow ${..} in ID and class notation 

convert compilation errs to Slim Src compilation errs

 afSlim
  - doctypes
  - compilation errs
  - runtime errs


For Future
==========

DocType step 1 - just HTML5 or XML, set via static config

 Multiple, non-HTML5 line endings
  - how do you specify this document wide (nested component) at render time? 
 Best to set at compiler time
 
 Don't make doctype an enum - for what about custom doctypes?
 
 Could doctype be a service / helper method?
 
 
Just a Bad Idea
===============
 
use ; for multiline? NO! - ; is used for HTML entities! => &amp;
